    "# Comparison \n",
    "\n",
    "This file allows one to perform comparisons between the ZigZag approach and three methods for tracking:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Tracking using OpenCV algorithms by means of the MultiTracker class)\n",
    "2) Tracking using OpenCV algorithms without using the MultiTracker class, but tracker instances individually for each detected object.\n",
    "3) Classical approach based on detector + centroids\n",
    "\n",
    "The comparison is performed using the folder \"dataset\" contained in the repository. For experiments 1) and 2) we use the different trackers available in OpenCV (\"csrt\", \"kcf\", \"boosting\", \"mil\", \"medianflow\", \"mosse\") as well as different detectors (findContours, Hough and findContours using the inner contours to detect the holes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that the experiments may need some hours to finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ground truth file is the same as in the Experiments Jupyter notebook (ground_truth.txt) and contains the real number of connected components and holes (appearing in at least 20 frames) of the videos. This file will be used to compare the results. \n",

    "This experiments have been carried out in a laptop with an Intel Core i7-4810MQ 3.8GHz (4 cores, 8 threads) and 24GB RAM, running Ubuntu 20.04. To run the experiments, several package are required (`pandas`, `imutils`, `natsort`, `opencv-contrib-python`)"

This is simply because sometimes the objects are separated in the first frame and a few frames later they are merged, then the zigzag method track them merged (if they appear merged for more than 20 frames), but the baseline methods track them separately. Since the baseline methods can be manually adapted to track them merged in such cases, we just count them as correct. Note also that Hough method can produce false positives in H1."
